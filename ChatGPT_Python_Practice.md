# For loops:
## Print the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.

for i in range(1, 11):
  print(i)


counter = 1
while counter <=10:
  print(counter)
  count +=2
## Print the even numbers from 2 to 20 using a for loop.

counter = 2
while counter <=20:
  print(counter)
  count +=2




## Print the numbers from 5 to -5 in decrements of 1 using a for loop.

counter = -5
while counter >=-5 and <=5:
  print(counter)
  count -=1

  numbers = (-5, 6, -1)
  for num in list:  
    print(num)

## Print the numbers from 10 to 1 in decrements of 1 using a for loop.

list = range (10, 0, -1)
for num in list:
  print(num)


## Print each character in the string "Hello" using a for loop.
String = "Hello"


## While loops:

## Print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
## Print the numbers from 10 to 1 in decrements of 1 using a while loop.
## Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a password until they enter "python123".
## Use a while loop to print the numbers 1 to 100, but print "fizz" for multiples of 3, "buzz" for multiples of 5, and "fizzbuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5.
## Use a while loop to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.
